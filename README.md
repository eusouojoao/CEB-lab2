# IST-CEB-Lab2 2022/2023 | [L2 - Differential Pair](Labs_2023_v0.pdf)

## Overview

This laboratory work aims to analyze the operation of a differential pair with resistive load. Specifically, we will analyze the transfer characteristic, voltage gains (differential mode and common mode), input resistance in the differential mode, input resistance in the common mode, common-mode rejection ratio, and input offset voltage.

The differential pair will be implemented using the CA3046 integrated circuit, which contains 5 bipolar transistors accessible through its pins.

### Contents of the Laboratory Work
- **Analysis:** Conduct a theoretical analysis of the differential pair circuit with resistive load.
- **Simulation:** Use the LTspice program for electrical simulations to validate the theoretical analysis and obtain performance characteristics of the differential pair.
- **Circuit Assembly:** Assemble the differential pair circuit on a breadboard and perform practical measurements.

## Objectives
- Analyze the functioning of a differential pair with resistive load.
- Study the transfer characteristic and voltage gains in differential and common modes.
- Determine the input resistance in differential and common modes.
- Calculate the common-mode rejection ratio and input offset voltage.
